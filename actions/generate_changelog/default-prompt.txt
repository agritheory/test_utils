<data>
PR Data:
{pr_data}
</data>

<instructions>
Use the pull request's commits, linked issues, description and related comments to generate the changelog. Focus on:
- Explaining changes in plain language that non-technical users will understand
- Describing new features in terms of what users can now do
- Explaining fixes in terms of problems that have been solved
- Mentioning any changes that users need to be aware of
- Document any actions that may be required by the users
- Being concise and factual
- Avoiding technical jargon, implementation details, and developer-centric information
</instructions>

<formatting>
Ensure the following considerations for generating the changelog:
- Format your response as Github-flavoured markdown.
- Do NOT categorize changes by type (features/fixes/etc).
- Present information factually ("This update adds...", "Fixed an issue where...")
- Use straightforward, objective language without marketing or promotional tone
- Avoid subjective qualifiers like "improved", "enhanced", "better" unless quantifiable
- Present changes as analytical, thoughtful, journalistic prose without bulleted lists, subheadings or emojis.
- Avoid phrases that use second-person language like "you will now be able to..."
</formatting>
